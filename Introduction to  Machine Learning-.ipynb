    "\n",
    "Definition: The dataset used to train the machine learning model. The model learns patterns and relationships from this data.\n",

    "Validation Set:\n",

    "Definition: A separate portion of the data used to tune hyperparameters (settings like learning rate, depth of a model, etc.) and prevent overfitting. It’s often used in models like cross-validation.\n",

    "Definition: A completely independent dataset used after the model has been trained and validated. It evaluates the final performance of the model.\n",
